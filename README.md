# Victroy-React-Project

This is a project designed by Renae Carter, Kenneth Latour, Chris Ou, and Caleb Summeralls. The project is a take on a fitness app which is a one stop shop for keeping a record on different cardio based exercises. You can track your cardio excercises from walking, running, swimming, rollerblading, and biking. Keep track of the distance, time, and calories burned to make sure you're getting the most out of your workout.

Hit the ground running quite literally:
to get started in our application please cd into the flatness-app in your own directory 

once there run 

json-server --watch db.json 

**this will mount the server on your local computer to keep track of your workouts and log them to our database

In a new terminal you will want to first run 

Bundle Install

npm start 

Then you should be sprinting to the finish line. Happy coding!

First tab you see is the Home section that has a description on what the app is about. Second tab is the About Us with a little something about all the integral members that made this app possible. Third tab is where the good stuff is. The List of Workouts tab where you can keep track of previous workouts and enter new workouts. You are able to favorite your workouts for various reasons be it a very long biking session, personal best time, or even if the scenary was nice that day. It's all up to you! It is also sorted by newest to oldest dates. A delete button to get rid of some old times.

### New update in the works...
Sort button to list favorites, oldest-newest, newest-oldest, and by workout type.
Implementing a gps tracker so you don't need to enter info.
More accurately calculates calories.
